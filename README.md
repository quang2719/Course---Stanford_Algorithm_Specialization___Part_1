This repository contains my learning materials, notes, and code implementations from the first course (1/4) of the **Stanford Algorithm Specialization** offered on Coursera. 

## ðŸŽ¯ Course Overview

This course delves into essential algorithms and techniques for problem-solving, including:

* **Asymptotic Analysis (Big-O Notation):** Understanding the efficiency and scalability of algorithms.
* **Sorting Algorithms:** Exploring various sorting techniques like Merge Sort and QuickSort.
* **Divide and Conquer:**  Breaking down problems into smaller, manageable subproblems and solving them recursively.
* **Randomized Algorithms:**  Harnessing the power of randomness to design efficient algorithms (e.g., randomized QuickSort).
* **Searching Algorithms:**  Efficiently finding specific elements within data structures.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents

* **Lecture Notes:** Summaries of key concepts and insights from each module.
* **Code Implementations:**  Working Python code examples for algorithms covered in the course. 
* **Assignments & Solutions:** (Optional, if you'd like to share your work) Solutions and explanations for course assignments.

## ðŸš€ Highlights


* **Comprehensive Code Repository:**  Explore a collection of well-documented Python code implementations for all major algorithms covered in the course.
* **Practice Problems & Solutions:**  Challenge yourself with practice problems and study my solutions to solidify your understanding of key concepts. 
* **Course Assignment Implementations:** Delve into my code for tackling the course assignments, showcasing practical applications of the algorithms.
